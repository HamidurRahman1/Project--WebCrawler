# WebCrawler

<pre>
<strong>A full-stack web development project with Java. Developed with PURE Servlet and JSP as 
well as JDBC for Database, JSOUP for parsing the crawled HTML pages and Linkedin UrlDetector 
for validating urls.</strong>

This application 'Search And Reporting Application' (SARA) is about crawling a valid url 
and retrieve page content(words) from those link(s) as well as simple words can be used 
to search and get appropriate results (links) from the database. The search words are going 
to be looked in the crawled links.

This application has two parts. An admin to access and crawling and the other part is where 
a user can search using simple words.

An admin must have valid username and password to access admin features. A valid admin can 
provide a reachable url and specify how many links from that link should be crawled and
extract the data from those links. Admin can also provide how depth should this crawling go
from the given link. As well as admin can see how many links have been crawled and the user searches.
